# kotlin-compatibility-test

This project shows how to achieve Kotlin-based API backward binary compatibility.

# How it shows that

`api1` is the old version of the API. `api2` is the new version of the API. `plugin` is a plugin complied with `api1`. `client` is a client running with `api2` and `plugin`. This is a Kotlin-based API backward binary compatibility playground.
